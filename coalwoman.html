                        sculpting was refined in Carrara, Italy, where she worked
                        with Alberto Sparapani, maestro sculptor renown for
                        Italy's

                        Her early work
                        delved into romantic and mythological subjects and was
                        soon recognized by private collectors. Susan's

                        Princess Diana on the occasion of their wedding in 1981,
                        and Susan has been sculpting everything from sports
                        legends to ballerinas ever since.
